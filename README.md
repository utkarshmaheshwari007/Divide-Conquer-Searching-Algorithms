# Divide-Conquer-Searching-Algorithms-STANFORD
Working with Asymptotic notations, searching divide and conquer master methods, matrix multiplications, different regression techniques used in Machine Learning and randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts).

## Topics covered in the course
1.Introduction; "big-oh" notation and asymptotic analysis.

2.Divide-and-conquer basics; the master method for analyzing divide and conquer algorithms.

3.The QuickSort algorithm and its analysis; probability review.

4.Linear-time selection; graphs, cuts, and the contraction algorithm.
